Making a calculator GUI that is easy to use and pleasant to look at

Current Status 2/6/2020: The GUI is most of the way there, I'm making some tweaks to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Still need to add comments, thats my first priority. and finally when those two things are done I will continue to increase the functionality by adding more mathmatical functions and a history so you can track your calculations.
